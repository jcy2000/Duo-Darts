<*You see Faye at the bar.*
<*The owner is talking with her while she orders a drink.*
>Owner
<Faybian right?
>Faye
<Umm, it’s actually Faye now.
>Owner
<It’s easier for me to call you Faybian though.
<I’ve known you as Faybian for years. 
<Can’t I just call you that?
<*You walk up to the conversation.*
>Faye
<It’s you.
>The owner
<Can I get you something?
	$Whatever she ordered. (+)
		&Sure. I’ll grab that for you.
	$Just fetching Faye. (+++)
		&*The owner places Faye’s drink in front of her and moves to the next customer.*
	$No I’m good.
		&Sounds good.
		&Anyways.
		&*Before he can continue his previous thought another customer calls him over.*
		&Excuse me.
>Faye
<*Faye grabs your arm with one hand and grabs her drink with the other. Leading you back to her lounge booth.*
[Lounge
<*You both sit down in the booth.*
<*Faye looks irritated.*
<I hate this league. No matter who I talk to, it's always the same question.
<Like, what do you think?
<*She sighs and drinks.*
<Maybe I should just quit and go somewhere else.
<Where nobody knew me before.
	$Maybe.
		&*She frowns.*
		&I hate ‘maybe’s.
	&Is it really that bad?
		&You’re an idiot.
	&Screw that. (++)
		&*Faye giggles.*
		&I’m a darts player first after all.
<*Faye seems recomposed.*
<I’ll keep going. Things will get better.
<I love this game too much.
<Thanks for getting me away from that idiot by the way.
<*You spend some time with Faye in her booth.*
